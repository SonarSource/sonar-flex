<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Overriding or shadowing a variable declared in an outer scope can strongly impact the readability, and therefore the maintainability, of a piece of
code. Further, it could lead maintainers to introduce bugs because they think they’re using one variable but are really using another.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
class Foo {
  public var myField:int;

  public function doSomething():String {
    var myField:int = 0;
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
